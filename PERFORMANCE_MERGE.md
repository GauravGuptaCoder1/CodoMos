## Benefits of Merge

1. **Better UX**: Single dashboard provides complete overview
2. **Reduced Navigation**: No need to switch between pages
3. **Contextual Information**: Projects and performance side-by-side
4. **Cleaner Menu**: Simplified navigation bar
5. **Faster Access**: All key metrics visible on landing page

---

## Data Integration

Currently using **mock data** in the Dashboard component. To connect to real backend:

1. Replace `performanceData` object with API calls to:
   - `/api/v1/xp/events` for performance scores
   - `/api/v1/users/me` for user-specific reviews
   - Create new endpoints for goals/OKRs if needed

2. Example integration:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadPerformance() {
    try {
      const [reviews, goals, scores] = await Promise.all([
        api.get('/reviews/'),
        api.get('/goals/'),
        api.get('/xp/events'),
      ])
      // Update state with real data
    } catch (err) {
      toast({ title: 'Failed to load performance data', status: 'error' })
    }
  }
  loadPerformance()
}, [])
```
